🌟 What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source runtime that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser. It’s perfect for creating fast, scalable server-side applications, from web servers to command-line tools, all using JavaScript.
Why Node.js?

Single Language: Use JavaScript for both frontend and backend.
Fast & Efficient: Built on Chrome’s V8 engine for high performance.
Versatile: Power apps like chat systems, APIs, or file servers.

Real-World Example:Imagine building a chat app like WhatsApp. With Node.js, you can create a server that handles real-time messages between users, keeping conversations smooth even with thousands online! 📱💬
