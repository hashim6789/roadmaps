# 🌐 Basics of Web Applications

Before diving into Node.js, let’s understand the basics of web apps, like a chat app you use daily! 😊 This guide explains the three main parts of a web app in a simple way. Let’s get started! 🚀

## 🤔 What Makes a Web App?

- A **web app** is a program that runs on a server and shows up in your browser (e.g., WhatsApp).
- Think of it as a restaurant: customers (users) order food (requests), the kitchen (server) prepares it, and a storage room (database) holds ingredients (data).

## 🛠️ The Three Main Parts

### 1. Client

- **What**: The part you see and interact with, like the chat app’s interface.
- **Tech**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (e.g., React or Angular).
- **Example**: The screen where you type and send messages.

### 2. Server

- **What**: Handles your requests and sends responses, like a chef cooking your order.
- **Tech**: Uses Node.js, PHP, or Java to process tasks.
- **Example**: When you send a message, the server saves it and notifies others.

### 3. Database

- **What**: Stores data, like a pantry storing ingredients.
- **Tech**: Uses MySQL or MongoDB to save and manage data.
- **Example**: Saves all your chat messages so you can see them later.

## 🎯 Follow-Up Activity: Plan a Chat App

Let’s plan a simple chat app to understand these parts!

### 1. Create a folder called `chat-plan`:

```bash
mkdir chat-plan
cd chat-plan
```

Create plan.txt and write:Client: A webpage to type and see messages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Server: Handles sending/receiving messages (Node.js).
Database: Stores messages (MongoDB).

Challenge: Add a feature idea for each part:
Client: Add a “dark mode” button.
Server: Notify users of new messages.
Database: Save user nicknames.
