# 🌊 The Node.js Stream Module

The **Stream** module in Node.js lets you handle large amounts of data efficiently, like streaming chat messages in a chat app! 😊 This guide explains streams simply, with real-world examples to help beginners get started. Let’s dive in! 🚀

## 🤔 What is the Stream Module?

- A **built-in module** in Node.js for processing data in chunks, not all at once.
- Ideal for handling big files, network data, or live chat messages without overloading memory.
- No need to install—it’s included with Node.js!

```js
// Import the Stream module
const { Readable, Writable } = require("node:stream");
```

## 🛠️ Why Use Streams?

- **_Efficiency_**: Process large data (e.g., a huge chat log) without crashing your app.
- **_Speed_**: Handle data as it arrives, like live chat messages.
- **_Flexibility_**: Work with files, network requests, or custom data in a chat app.

## 🌟 The Four Types of Streams

Streams come in four types, each with a real-world example tied to a chat app:

### 1. Readable Streams

- **What**: Streams you read data from, like a water tap pouring water.
- **Real-World Example**: Reading a chat log file line by line to display old messages in a chat app.

```js
// Readable stream: Read a chat log
const fs = require("node:fs");
const readable = fs.createReadStream("chat.txt", { encoding: "utf8" });
readable.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Received chunk: ${chunk}`);
});
readable.on("end", () => {
  console.log("Finished reading chat log!");
});
```

### 2. Writable Streams

- **What**: Streams you write data to, like pouring water into a bucket.
- **Real-World Example**: Saving incoming chat messages to a log file in real-time.

```js
// Writable stream: Save chat messages
const fs = require("node:fs");
const writable = fs.createWriteStream("chat.txt");
writable.write("Alex: Hi!\n");
writable.write("Sarah: Hello!\n");
writable.end(() => {
  console.log("Messages saved!");
});
```

### 3. Duplex Streams

- **What**: Streams you can read from and write to, like a two-way phone call.
- **Real-World Example**: A WebSocket connection in a chat app, where you send and receive messages simultaneously.

```js
// Duplex stream: Simulate a chat connection
const { Duplex } = require("node:stream");
const chatDuplex = new Duplex({
  read() {},
  write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    console.log(`Received: ${chunk}`);
    this.push(`Echo: ${chunk}`); // Echo back
    callback();
  },
});
chatDuplex.write("Alex: Hey!");
chatDuplex.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Server: ${chunk}`);
});
```

### 4. Transform Streams

- **What**: Streams that modify data as it passes through, like a water filter.
- **Real-World Example**: Converting chat messages to uppercase before saving them to a log.

```js
// Transform stream: Uppercase messages
const { Transform } = require("node:stream");
const uppercase = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    this.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
    callback();
  },
});
const fs = require("node:fs");
const readable = fs.createReadStream("chat.txt");
const writable = fs.createWriteStream("uppercase-chat.txt");
readable.pipe(uppercase).pipe(writable);
writable.on("finish", () => {
  console.log("Messages converted to uppercase!");
});
```

## 📋 Common Stream Methods

Here’s a table of key `stream` methods you’ll use:

| Method        | Description                                  | Example                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `on('data')`  | Listens for data chunks in Readable streams. | `readable.on('data', (chunk) => { ... })` |
| `write()`     | Writes data to Writable streams.             | `writable.write('data')`                  |
| `end()`       | Signals no more data for Writable streams.   | `writable.end()`                          |
| `pipe()`      | Connects a Readable to a Writable stream.    | `readable.pipe(writable)`                 |
| `push()`      | Adds data to Readable or Duplex streams.     | `duplex.push('data')`                     |
| `transform()` | Modifies data in Transform streams.          | `transform(chunk, encoding, callback)`    |

## 🎯 Follow-Up Activity: Stream Chat Messages

Create a streaming chat log system using the stream module!

Create a folder called stream-chat:

```bash
mkdir stream-chat
cd stream-chat
```

Create chat-stream.js:

```js
const fs = require("node:fs");
const { Transform } = require("node:stream");
// Create a transform stream to add [Your Name]
const addName = new Transform({
transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
this.push(`[Your Name]: ${chunk}`);
callback();
}
});
// Stream messages
const readable = fs.createReadStream("input.txt", { encoding: "utf8" };
const writable = fs.createWriteStream("chat-log.txt");
readable.pipe(addName).pipe(writable);
writable.on("finish", () => {
console.log("Chat log created!");
});
```

Create input.txt:

```sh
Hi, everyone!
Ready to chat?
```

Run it:

```bash
node chat-stream.js
```

Challenge: Log chunks to the console:

```js
addName.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(`Processing: ${chunk}`);
});
```
